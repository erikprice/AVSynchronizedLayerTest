# AVSynchronizedLayerTest

This is a Mac (OS X 10.7) project which demonstrates how to use an AVSynchronizedLayer to display some subtitles with a video playing an in AVPlayerLayer.

To run the project you will have to change the path to the video in AppDelegate.h.

The video either needs to be longer than 1minute 20 seconds or you need to edit the subtitles in setupSubtitles in AppDelegate.m
